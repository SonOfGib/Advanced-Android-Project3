# Advanced-Android-Project3
This app is my submission for the third advanced android lab.

It meets the requirements of allowing a user to share their public key via android beam, and allowing the user to send an encrypted message over android beam.

Flow of the app is as follows.
The user must first set a username, this creates their private-public RSA key pair.
The user then must share their public key with another person, and vice versa.
Then the user can send and recieve messages, but they must specify who the message is to be sent to so it can be properly encrypted.
